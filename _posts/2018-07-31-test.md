Built using Jekyll and Materialize, this website served as a portfolio for Stuy Fission, team 310, a [First Tech Challenge](https://www.firstinspires.org/robotics/ftc) robotics team from Stuyvesant High School, New York. This website allowed us to post periodic updates onto the blog, updating other teams about our progress and increasing our social media presence.
