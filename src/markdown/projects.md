### FIRST Tech Challenge: Stuy Fission Team 310

As the Head of Software Engineering on Stuy Fission, I created the Stuy Fission website and wrote the robot code for the '17-'18 season, Relic Recovery.
Built using Jekyll and Materialize, the website served as a portfolio and a blog. The robot code, another “relic” of my time on Stuy Fission, was developed throughout the competition season and controlled our robot's driver-controlled and autonomous movement.
